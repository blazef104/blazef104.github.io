I currently work as a Security Automation Engineer in a research company.

I previously worked as a Threat Hunter and Detection Engineer at Countercept.

I have a MSc in Cybersecurity from Sapienza University of Rome. Thesis [here](https://github.com/blazef104/MasterThesis).

My BSc is in Systems and Network Security from the University of Milan. Thesis [here](https://github.com/blazef104/bachelor_thesis).

I love everything plane and technology (not necessarly together). Iâ€™m really interested in low level code and hardware hacking. In my free time I like to create tools to help my day to day life :)
