      <description>My first research was not very productive in term of results, however i learned a lot and it was very interesting. Living in Finland was not easy but it turned out to be really fun and beautiful.
We produced different tools that can, hopefully, help other people expanding our work in this field. They can be found here and as I continue to explore this field in my free time I hope I will be able to expand the repository more.</description>
